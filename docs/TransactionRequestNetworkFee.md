# TransactionRequestNetworkFee

For EVM-based blockchains only. The total transaction fee in the blockchainâ€™s largest unit. Note: Only two of the three arguments can be specified in a single transaction: `gasLimit`, `gasPrice` and `networkFee`. Fireblocks recommends using a numeric string for accurate precision. Although a number input exists, it is deprecated. - The transaction blockchain fee. - For Ethereum, you can't pass gasPrice, gasLimit and networkFee all together. - A numeric value representation is required.
