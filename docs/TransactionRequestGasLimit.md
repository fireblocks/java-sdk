# TransactionRequestGasLimit

For EVM-based blockchains only. Units of gas required to process the transaction. Note: Only two of the three arguments can be specified in a single transaction: `gasLimit`, `gasPrice` and `networkFee`. Fireblocks recommends using a numeric string for accurate precision. Although a number input exists, it is deprecated.
