     * &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a new cross-border settlement configuration. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Configurations define the default assets, on-ramps, and off-ramps to use for the cross-border settlement. &lt;/br&gt;  A configuration must contain at least two steps - &#x60;ON_RAMP&#x60; and &#x60;VAULT_ACCOUNT&#x60;. &lt;/br&gt; All other steps (e.g., &#x60;OFF_RAMP&#x60;, &#x60;FIAT_DESTINATION&#x60;, etc.) are optional. &lt;/br&gt; Every step must include the &#x60;accountId&#x60; to be used, while &#x60;inputAssetId&#x60; and &#x60;outputAssetId&#x60; are optional.  If those are not provided, a default value will be used from the Corridor Settings.&lt;/br&gt; If the inputAssetId or the outputAssetId is provided for one of the objects, all assets in the objects must be consistent. For example, if the output asset of ON_RAMP is XLM_USDC_5F3T, then the input asset of the VAULT_ACCOUNT must also be XLM_USDC_5F3T..&lt;/br&gt; You can set a slippage amount for your configuration. Slippage is defined by basis points (bps). This value can be overloaded on execution. If you do not configure a slippage amount, the default slippage of 10000 bps (10%) is used. &lt;/br&gt; **Note:** The reference content in this section documents the Payments Engine endpoint.
