/**
 * * &#x60;TRANSFER&#x60; - Transfers funds from one account to another. UTXO blockchains allow
 * multi-input and multi-output transfers. All other blockchains allow transfers with one source
 * address and one destination address. * &#x60;MINT&#x60; - Mints new tokens. Supported for
 * Stellar, Ripple and EVM-based blockchains. * &#x60;BURN&#x60; - Burns tokens. Supported for
 * Stellar, Ripple and EVM-based blockchains. * &#x60;CONTRACT_CALL&#x60; - Calls a smart contract
 * method for web3 operations on any EVM blockchain. The Fireblocks [development
 * libraries](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/ethereum-development#convenience-libraries) are
 * recommended for building contract call transactions. * &#x60;TYPED_MESSAGE&#x60; - An off-chain
 * message in either Ethereum Personal Message or EIP712 format. Use it to sign specific readable
 * messages that are not actual transactions. [Learn more about typed
 * messages](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/typed-message-signing). * &#x60;RAW&#x60; - An
 * off-chain message with no predefined format. Use it to sign any message with your private key,
 * including protocols such as blockchains and custom transaction types that are not natively
 * supported by Fireblocks. [Learn more about raw signing
 * transactions.](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/raw-message-signing) *
 * &#x60;ENABLE_ASSET&#x60; - Algorand, DigitalBits, Solana, and Stellar require an on-chain
 * transaction to create an asset wallet and enable the deposit address. This transaction is
 * automatically created when adding assets on these blockchains at a vault account. *
 * &#x60;STAKE&#x60; - Assign assets to a staking pool managed by a staking validator. Supported for
 * Stellar and EVM-based blockchains. This transaction is automatically created when performing
 * staking operations. * &#x60;UNSTAKE&#x60; - Remove assets from a staking pool managed by a
 * staking validator. Supported for Stellar and EVM-based blockchains. This transaction is
 * automatically created when performing staking operations. * &#x60;WITHDRAW&#x60; - Transfer
 * assets from a dedicated staking vault account to another address. Supported for Stellar and
 * EVM-based blockchains. This transaction is automatically created when performing staking
 * operations. **Note:** Fireblocks will rename this type from &#x60;WITHDRAW&#x60; to a different
 * type name soon. There will be a 7-day notice regarding the new type name. *
 * &#x60;SUPPLY_TO_COMPOUND&#x60; - Deprecated since April 1st, 2023. Older transactions may have
 * this as their operation, in case users in the workspace have used the direct integration between
 * Fireblocks and the Compound DeFI protocol. * &#x60;REDEEM_FROM_COMPOUND&#x60; - Deprecated since
 * April 1st, 2023. Older transactions may have this as their operation, in case users in the
 * workspace have used the direct integration between Fireblocks and the Compound DeFI protocol. *
 * &#x60;PROGRAM_CALL&#x60; - In Solana refers to invoking on-chain programs (smart contracts) to
 * execute transactions and interact with the blockchain. * &#x60;APPROVE&#x60; - Enables the
 * approve function for a smart contract or wallet to withdraw from a designated wallet. [Learn
 * more](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404616097426-Amount-Cap-for-Approve-transactions).
